# HearSay
 
HearSay is a mobile application that is indended to work as a novel aid for people with hearing disabilities.
The application uses a combination of microsoft cognitive services to listen in to what is being said in a room, detect if a specific name is mentioned and then provide the sentiment with with the name is being mentioned in, i.e. whether is good or bad.

The idea came about after spending time with a family who had a hearing impaired daughter, and I noticed that they tended to talk or gossip about her while she was in the same room as them. Because he could not hear she was not always aware that she was the topic of conversation.
Thus this application is aimed to aid with this specific scenario
